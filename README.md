JS-Libs
=======

Trying the same rather complicated example with one or more JS libs/frameworks for comparison purposes.


The problem we're trying to solve is that we want to ask our users some questions very nicely. We're basically asking people to choose from a list, but we have a pretty UX to help people choose. Some of the questions have follow up questions, so the interaction is somewhat complicated. 

The data that represents the questions is actually much more complicated than the data that represents the answers. This means that typical Model-View parity that you see in all the MV* examples doesn't really work. So I'm trying to dash out a few quick prototypes with some libraries to see if I can narrow down the options.
